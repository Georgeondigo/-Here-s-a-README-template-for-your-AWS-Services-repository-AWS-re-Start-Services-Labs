# AWS re/Start Services Labs

Welcome to my AWS re/Start Labs repository! This collection includes the lab exercises I've completed as part of the AWS re/Start program. These labs cover a variety of AWS services and practices, including automation, deployment, scaling, security, storage, and monitoring. Each lab has helped me gain hands-on experience and deepen my understanding of cloud computing with AWS.

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you'll find the following lab exercises I’ve completed:

### Lab Exercises

- **`168-[SYOP]-Lab - Install and Configure the AWS CLI.txt`**: In this lab, I learned how to install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). The AWS CLI allows me to manage AWS services from the command line, making it easier to interact with AWS resources programmatically.

- **`169-[TOOL]-Lab - Using AWS Systems Manager.txt`**: This lab focused on AWS Systems Manager, a service that provides operational data from multiple AWS services. I explored how to use Systems Manager to automate administrative tasks and manage infrastructure more efficiently.

- **`170-[SERV]-Lab - Create a Website on S3.txt`**: Here, I created and hosted a static website using Amazon S3. This lab demonstrated how S3 can be used for web hosting, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for static website deployments.

- **`171-[SERV]-Lab - Creating Amazon EC2 Instances.txt`**: In this lab, I learned how to launch and manage Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances. EC2 instances are scalable virtual servers, and this lab covered the essential setup and management tasks.

- **`172-[SERV]-Lab - [Challenge] Linux EC2 Instance.txt`**: This challenge lab involved managing a Linux-based EC2 instance. I performed tasks such as configuration and software installation to deepen my understanding of Linux instance management.

- **`173-[SERV]-Lab - Troubleshoot Create Instance.txt`**: This lab was all about troubleshooting issues that can occur during EC2 instance creation. I tackled common problems and found solutions to ensure smooth instance launches.

- **`174-[SCAL]-Lab - Scale and Load Balance your Architecture.txt`**: I explored scaling and load balancing my AWS architecture to handle increased traffic and ensure high availability. This lab covered key concepts like Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Auto Scaling.

- **`175-[SCAL]-Lab - Using Auto Scaling in AWS (Linux).txt`**: This lab focused on using AWS Auto Scaling to adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand. I configured Auto Scaling for Linux instances to maintain performance and cost efficiency.

- **`176-[SCAL]-Lab - Route 53 Failover Routing.txt`**: I set up failover routing with Amazon Route 53 in this lab. Failover routing ensures that traffic is directed to a backup resource if the primary resource becomes unavailable.

- **`177-[SECO]-Lab - [Challenge] AWS Lambda Exercise.txt`**: This challenge lab involved working with AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service. I created and managed Lambda functions to perform tasks without managing servers.

- **`178-[SECO]-Lab - Working with AWS Lambda.txt`**: I dove deeper into AWS Lambda in this lab, learning how to create, deploy, and manage serverless functions to handle various computing tasks.

- **`179-[AWSD]-Lab - Migrate to Amazon RDS.txt`**: In this lab, I migrated databases to Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), which offers managed relational database solutions. I covered the migration process and best practices for using RDS.

- **`180-[AWSN]-Lab - Configuring an Amazon VPC.txt`**: This lab focused on configuring an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), allowing me to create a logically isolated network within AWS. I learned about VPC setup, subnet configuration, and network security.

- **`181-[AWSN]-Activity - Troubleshoot a VPC.txt`**: I worked on troubleshooting issues within an Amazon VPC in this activity. I addressed common networking problems and found solutions to ensure proper VPC operation.

- **`182-[STOR]-Lab - Working with Amazon EBS.txt`**: This lab involved using Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), which provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances. I managed EBS volumes, snapshots, and performance optimization.

- **`183-[STOR]-Lab - Managing Storage.txt`**: I covered various storage management tasks within AWS, including optimizing and configuring storage solutions. This lab helped me understand how to manage different types of storage resources effectively.

- **`184-[STOR]-Lab - [Challenge] S3 Exercise.txt`**: In this challenge lab, I tackled advanced use cases and configurations for Amazon S3, focusing on data storage, security, and access management.

- **`185-[STOR]-Lab - Work with Amazon S3.txt`**: I worked with Amazon S3 for object storage in this lab. I learned how to upload, manage, and secure data within S3.

- **`186-[JAWS]-Lab - Monitoring Infrastructure.txt`**: This lab covered the monitoring of AWS infrastructure to ensure optimal performance and availability. I explored tools and services for monitoring, including Amazon CloudWatch.

- **`187-[JAWS]-Activity - Working with AWS CloudTrail.txt`**: I worked with AWS CloudTrail in this activity, which provides logging and monitoring of API calls within my AWS account. I learned how to use CloudTrail to track and audit activities.

- **`188-[JAWS]-Lab - Managing Resources with Tagging.txt`**: This lab explained how to use resource tagging to manage and organize AWS resources effectively. Tagging helps with resource tracking, cost allocation, and overall management.

- **`189-[JAWS]-Activity - Optimize Utilization.txt`**: I focused on optimizing the utilization of AWS resources in this activity. I explored strategies to improve cost efficiency and performance by optimizing resource usage.

- **`190-[JAWS]-Lab - Automating Deployments with AWS CloudFormation.txt`**: This lab involved automating the deployment of AWS resources using AWS CloudFormation. I defined infrastructure as code to simplify and automate deployment processes.

- **`192-[JAWS]-Lab - [Challenge] CloudFormation.txt`**: A challenge lab that required using AWS CloudFormation for more complex deployment scenarios. I applied my skills in creating and managing sophisticated infrastructure setups using CloudFormation.
